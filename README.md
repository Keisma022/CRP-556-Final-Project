# CRP-556-Final-Project
This project is an ArcGIS Pro Python Toolbox that automates the analysis and mapping of impervious surface change for cities using NLCD Impervious Surface raster data. The workflow clips NLCD rasters to a city boundary, computes change between years, classifies change magnitude, and exports maps and CSV summaries.
